## 💥EZquip (auto equip gear) 

An addon for World of Warcraft. The addon is meant to allow the player to import a statWeight string which the addon will use to automatically build a set of best in bags items, and equip it!

## Getting Started

To use this addon, you will need some stat weights⚖️for your character. `Stat weights` are used to score items in your bags/inventory before being ezquipped. You can enter stat weights manually via the options window, or you can import stat weights from a string. You can get a rough and ready import string from [Pawn](https://beta.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn), just open the Pawn UI > click 'Scale' > click 'Manual' > select a scale > click 'export'. Alternatively, you can visit [raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/quick) and run a quick sim to get your stat weights.
