üí•EZquip (auto equip gear) 

An addon for World of Warcraft. The addon is meant to allow the player to import a statWeight string which the addon will use to automatically build a set of best in bags items, and equip it!

## Getting Started
To use this addon, you will want some stat weights‚öñÔ∏èfor your character. `Stat weights` are used to score items in your bags/inventory which are added to a set and ezquipped. You can enter stat weights manually via addon options, or you can import stat weights from a string. To get a rough and ready stat weights import string (and you [Pawn](https://beta.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn)) open the Pawn UI > click 'Scale' > click 'Manual' > select a scale > click 'export'. Alternatively, you can visit [raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/quick), or even [askmrrobot](https://www.askmrrobot.com/)(if you're already a user).

### Where to download the addon.
<!-- - [Curse]()
- [Wago]()
- [WoW Interface]() -->
- [GitHub](https://github.com/furtrade/EZquip/releases)

## Known Issues
- (Working on it) Not all weapon configs have been implemented. Namely, Dual-Wielding. This means dual wielding weapon configs will not be scored. 
- (Working on it) Class preferences have not been implemented. E.g. Ranged vs Melee preference, 2Hand vs a Mainhand + Offhand, etc.
- üêáNeeds testing. Due to currently unknown circumstances, the addon may fail to ezquip a group of items but not others.
