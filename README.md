#### 💥EZquip was designed to enable players to build and equip sets of best-in-bags items.

## TLDR
Set stat weights, run ezquip.

## Getting Started
You will need some stat weights⚖️for your character to use this addon. Stat weights are necessary to evaluate equipable items in your bags/inventory. You can manually enter stat weights via the options window or import stat weights from a string. You can get a rough and ready import string from [Pawn](https://beta.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn) by first opening the Pawn UI > click 'Scale' > click 'Manual' > select a scale > click 'export' and there you have it. Alternatively, you can visit [raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/quick) and run a quick sim to get your stat weights.

### Where to download the addon.
<!-- - [Curse]()
- [WoW Interface]() -->
- [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/ezquip)
- [Curse](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ezquip)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/furtrade/ezquip)

## Known Issues
- Some stat weights might be missing, while others might not be applicable to _retail.
- Some types of weapons might not be getting scored correctly. This is likely due to an interaction between class and weapon profficiency.
- Found an issue? Let me know plz. [here](https://github.com/furtrade/EZquip/issues)

## In Progress
- Add "contexts" to alter ezquip behavior based on situation. E.g. spec, battleground, raid, etc.
- Add feature to save sets.
- Add scoring for gem sockets.
- Add support for price checks before equipping BoEs.
- Add ilvl (+mainstat) mode. Attempt to ezquip based solely on ilvl and mainstat.

## Accessibility 
There is an active community of wow players who play the game in spite of a disability or impairment that I would like to appeal to. I think this addon could really be a helpful accessibility addon that aids these players with playing the game. I know, for example, that low-vision players strain to see tooltips and would benefit from using EZquip. If you know someone like that, perhaps you could recommend that they give it a try.
