ðŸ’¥EZquip (auto equip gear) 

An addon for World of Warcraft. The addon is meant to allow the player to import a statWeight string which the addon will use to automatically build a set of best in bags items, and equip it!

## Getting Started
To use this addon, you will want some `stat weights` for your character. Stat weights are used to score items in your bags/inventory which are added to a set and ezquipped. You can enter stat weights manually via addon options, or you can import stat weights from a string. To get a rough and ready stat weights import string (and you [Pawn](https://beta.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn)) open the Pawn UI > click 'Scale' > click 'Manual' > select a scale > click 'export'. Alternatively, you can visit [raidbots](https://www.raidbots.com/simbot/quick), or even [askmrrobot](https://www.askmrrobot.com/)(if you're already a user).
